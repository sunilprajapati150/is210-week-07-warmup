Overview
========

Combined with Python's data structures, Python's library of looping techniques
allow for the efficient processing of massive amounts of data.

Instructions
============

The following tasks will either have you interacting with existing files in
the assignment repository or creating new ones on the fly. Don't forget to add
your interpreter directive, utf-8 encoding, and a short docstring with any new
files that you create!

.. important::

    In these exercises, you may, on occasion, come across a task that requres
    you to research or use a function or method not directly covered by the
    course text. Since Python is such a large language it would be impossible
    for the author to have included descriptions of each and every available
    function which would largely duplicate the offical Python documentation.

    A *vital* skill to successful programming is being comfortable searching
    for and using official language documentation sources like the
    `Python String Documentation`_ page. Throughout our coursework we will be
    practicing both the use of the language in practice and the search skills
    necessary to become functional programmers.

Warmup Tasks
============

Task 01
-------

In this task, we're going to build a Fibonacci sequence generator function with
our ``while`` loop.

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Begin by considering the following statement:

    .. code:: python

        lastnum, curnum = curnum, lastnum + curnum

    This is a Python trait known as *multiple assignment* and is part of the
    magic of tuple unpacking since the right side of the assignment operator is
    a tuple (without its parentheses). This is is a key feature of our
    particular implementation since the following is **not** equivalent:

    .. code:: python

        lastnum = curnum
        curnum = lastnum + curnum

    Note how, on the first line, the value of ``lastnum`` is changed so that
    its value is no longer valid for the ``curnum`` assignment.

    The benefit of multliple assignment in our scenario is that both
    variables may be assigned simultaneously, **before** their values change.

    Looped, this is the heart of the fibonacci sequence better illustrated at:

    https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#first-steps-towards-programming

    We'll be performing a similar loop but doing so in a more programmatic
    manner.

2.  Create a new module named ``task_01.py``

3.  Create a new function named ``fibonacci()`` that takes one required
    parameter:

    1.  ``maxint``, an integer that will serve as the upper bound of the loop

4.  Following the example on the Python tutorial:

    https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#first-steps-towards-programming

    Our implementation will have a few changes:

    1.  While you will use a ``while`` loop to make a Fibonacci sequence, the
        upper bound of the sequence will be your ``maxint`` parameter.

    2.  Store the results into a list and append each new generated number

5.  Return the newly generated sequence as a list.

.. note::

    In our example we are choosing to include the initial ``0`` value.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

.. code:: pycon

    >>> import task_01
    >>> task_01.fibonacci(10)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

Task 02
-------

In this task, we'll practice our use of the ``if`` statement by creating a
small function that can return a 'yes' or 'no' value equivalent of truthy or
falsy values.

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Create a new module named ``task_02.py``

2.  Create a function named ``bool_to_str`` that takes one required argument:

    1.  ``bval`` a boolean or boolean-like value that can be evaluated for
        truthiness or falsiness

3.  Use a simple ``if`` and ``else`` statement to determine if the passed
    value is truthy or falsy.

4. if the value is truthy, return the string, ``'Yes'`` otherwise, return the
   string ``'No'``

.. important::

    Always avoid multiple returns, when possible. Set your return value into
    a variable and use just one return at the end of the function.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

.. code:: pycon

    >>> import task_02
    >>> task_02.bool_to_str(True)
    'Yes'

    >>> import task_02
    >>> task 02.bool_to_str('')
    'No'

Task 03
-------

In this task, you'll be asked to create a simple for-loop to loop over a simple
data construct, in this case, to provide the maximum, minimum, and average
length of words in a speech performing a lexicographical analysis not unlike
what's used to measure reading level.

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Create a new module named ``task_03.py``

2.  Create a function named ``lexicographics()`` that takes one parameter:

    1.  ``to_analyze``, a **required** string

3.  Using a single ``for`` loop, calculate the following for your text:

    #.  The maximum number of words **per line** in ``to_analyze`` (eg, the
        length of the longest line in ``to_analyze``)

    #.  The minimum number of words **per line** in ``to_analyze`` (eg, the
        length of the shortest line in ``to_analyze``)

    #.  The average number of words **per line** in ``to_analyze``, stored
        as a decimal.

4.  Return these values as a tuple, in the order in which they are defined
    above.

.. hint::

    As with other for-loop endeavors, you'll need to set up some variables
    outside of your loop to catch your data as you process it.

.. hint::

    You'll have to ``split()`` the string twice to accomplish this task. First
    split it on just the newline (``\n``) to produce an iterable list of
    lines. As you iterate each line, you can then use ``split()`` again
    without any parameters to count the number of words.

.. tip::

    There are at least two good ways to solve this problem each with their
    own benefits. One way uses the ``max()``, ``min()`` and ``sum()`` functions
    to operate on a list, and the other involves using ``if`` to set-up running
    totals. Either are acceptable routes.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

.. code:: pycon

    >>> import task_03
    >>> task_03.lexicographics('''Don't stop believing,
    Hold on to that feeling.''')
    (5, 3, Decimal(4.0))

If you'd like to see a more interesting implementation of your function, try
importing the St. Crispian's Day speech from William Shakespeare's play, *Henry
V*, conveniently provided as part of this project:

.. code:: pycon

    >>> import task_03
    >>> import data
    >>> task_03.lexicographics(data.SHAKESPEARE)
    (12, 5, Decimal('8.14'))

Executing Tests
===============

Code must be functional and pass tests before it will be eligible for credit.

Linting
-------

Lint tests check your code for syntactic or stylistic errors To execute lint
tests against a specific file, simply open a terminal in the same directory as
your code repository and type:

.. code:: console

    $ pylint filename.py

Where ``filename.py`` is the name of the file you wish to lint test.

Unit Tests
----------

Unit tests check that your code performs the tested objectives. Unit tests
may be executed individually by opening a terminal in the same directory as
your code repository and typing:

.. code:: console

    $ nosetests tests/name_of_test.py

Where ``name_of_test.py`` is the name of the testfile found in the ``tests``
directory of your source code.

Running All Tests
-----------------

All tests may be run simultaneously by executing the ``runtests.sh`` script
from the root of your assignment repository. To execute all tests, open a
terminal in the same directory as your code repository and type:

.. code:: console

    $ ./runtests.sh

Submission
==========

Code should be submitted to `GitHub`_ by means of opening a pull request.

As-of Lesson 02, each student will have a branch named after his or her
`GitHub`_ username. Pull requests should be made against the branch that
matches your `GitHub`_ username. Pull requests made against other branches will
be closed.  This work flow mimics the steps you took to open a pull request
against the ``pull`` branch in Week Two.

For a refresher on how to open a pull request, please see homework instructions
in Lesson 01. It is recommended that you run PyLint locally after each file
is edited in order to reduce the number of errors found in testing.

In order to receive full credit you must complete the assignment as-instructed
and without any violations (reported in the build status). There will be
automated tests for this assignment to provide early feedback on program code.

When you have completed this assignment, please post the link to your
pull request in the body of the assignment on Blackboard in order to receive
credit.
